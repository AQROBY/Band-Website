# Evanescence Band Website

This project is a website made for the rock-metal band Evanescence. It's a project made for practicing my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills.

The website can be accessed at: 
```sh
https://evanescence-project.000webhostapp.com/
```

The website contains 3 pages:

  - The home/index page that contains the menu, a play button that plays the band's music, and some other info

  - The store page that contains the menu, merchandise, and a dynamic cart that updates any time an item is added, the quantity of an item is changed or an item is deleted from the cart
